    "Question:1 What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "ANSWER :- A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences between SQL and NoSQL\n",
    "SQL pronounced as “S-Q-L” or as “See-Quel” is primarily called RDBMS or Relational Databases, whereas NoSQL is a Non-relational or Distributed Database.\n",
    "Comparing SQL vs NoSQL databases, SQL databases are table-based databases, whereas NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pairs, and graph databases.\n",
    "SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.\n",
    "SQL databases have a predefined schema, whereas NoSQL databases use a dynamic schema for unstructured data.\n",
    "Comparing NoSQL vs SQL performance, SQL requires specialized DB hardware for better performance while NoSQL uses commodity hardware.\n"

    "ANS:- A DML (data manipulation language) refers to a computer programming language that allows you to add (insert), delete (delete), and alter (update) data in a database. A DML is typically a sublanguage of a larger database language like SQL, with the DML containing some of the language's operators\n",
